# Course Files
This repo contains all test files for my premium Vim cash course: 

The files are nothing special:
1. `vimCC.txt` was created by me and is a combination of `smb.conf`, `sshd_config`, and a few other standard linux files.
2. The PHP files are take directly from https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject, so full credit to them 👌
